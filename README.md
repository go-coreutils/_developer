# Go-CoreUtils Developer Repository

This repository is intended to provide a common set of makefiles, helper
scripting and most importantly, contain documentation for getting involved
with Go-CoreUtils projects.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

As there is no code of conduct written yet, no contributions can be accepted at
this time, including suggested codes of conduct.

It would not be fair to you to get involved, nor for the existing authors
to become involved with the creation of a code of conduct after projects
have already started.

Any agreements to the code of conduct would require everyone's concent or face
the consequences of a fractured community, hurt feelings and forked or
trainwrecked projects, let alone the licensing issues.

As with the Go-Curses, Go-CoreLibs and Go-Enjin projects, all of these
are intended for a very long-term lifespan with the intent of having these
things integrated into an academic context among other things.

So, in order to avert early-onset struggles, all of these projects are running
silent and accepting no contributors nor contributions at this time.

Once a code of conduct as been implemented and a process established for the
long-term governance, then and only then can contributors be welcomed and
mentored.
